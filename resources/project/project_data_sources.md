# Open Data for Projects

This is a dynamic list of data sources that might be useful for projects. It is by no means exhaustive or complete, but includes many catalogs that contain hundreds of independent data products, many hosted in the cloud with code/tutorials for easy access.

If you find others that should be included here, please open a PR to add or send me a note.
