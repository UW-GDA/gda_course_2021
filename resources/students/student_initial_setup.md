# Student Initial Setup

1. We will use Slack for most communication and discussion. Please sign up for the course workspace here (using your UW email address): 
    * If you are unfamiliar with Slack, see intro material here: https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members
    * I recommend that you use the standalone desktop app rather than the web interface
1. Please create a Github account if you do not have one already: https://github.com/join
    * Send me a direct slack message with your github username (do this as soon as possible)
    * We will be using a Github organization (https://github.com/UW-GDA) and I will distribute materials/assignments using Github Classroom, which is linked to your github account.
    * If all of this is new, donâ€™t worry, we will walk through basic workflows during the first lecture/lab, and you will become more familiar in the coming weeks.
    * I recommend you apply for the free edu account upgrade (https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new), which will allow you to create unlimited number of private repos with unlimited collaborators.
1. Sign up for a ReviewNB account: https://www.reviewnb.com/
    * This is what we will use for interactive, inline discussion on notebooks that you submit
    * Sign up for the free/educational plan and link to your github account
1. If you have not already done so, please sign up for an institutional Google account using your UW email address.  I will use Google Docs for some material and Google Drive for some data distribution, and I will only enable access for UW Google accounts (not personal accounts).
1. Install/upgrade QGIS on your computer
