# Week 6: Vector 2, Geometries, Spatial Operations, Visualization

UW Geospatial Data Analysis  
CEE498/CEWA599  
David Shean  

This week, we are going to revisit vectors, geometry operations, spatial/attribute joins, and more sophisticated visualization.  We will illustrate some of these concepts with the GLAS point dataset and the U.S. State outlines.

## Reading and Tutorials
Please take some time to review the following material (especially if you have limited GIS experience), and come with questions on topics that are unclear, so we can discuss together.  There is some overlap in content, but different presentation of the essential material, so hopefully one or more will work for you:

### Vectors
* *Optional* Review Lesson 2: https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/lessons/L2/overview.html
* Lessons 3, 4, 5 from https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/index.html
    * There are recorded videos for each of these, but you should be able to go through written material at your own pace using the "next" buttons at bottom of page
    * Can Skip Geocoding in Lesson 3

### Geopandas and Shapely Documentation
